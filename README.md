# What's this?

Here's a small sample of XInput. I'm using the XBox360's preferred controller.

XInput seems to support free input in a fairly small amount of code. Very easy to use.

# How to make and run?


1) Wakeup with VS2019 console mode.
![VS2019 run prepare make](./images/1_make.png)

2) run make.bat
![VS2019 domake](./images/2_domake.png)

3) run xinput.exe
![VS2019 run](./images/3_run.png)
